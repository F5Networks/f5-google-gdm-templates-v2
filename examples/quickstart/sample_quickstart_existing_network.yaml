# NOTE: When filling out the parameter values for this deployment:
# Deployments leverage .schema files to help enforce requirements/parameter typing and defaults.
# '###' Will be used above each parameter and contain description of values required
# REQUIRED parameters values are left empty and value MUST be entered.
# OPTIONAL parameters contain defaults (same default from schema file).
# However, some are deployment specific and generally should be modified to match your environment.
#
# CAUTION:
# Use single quotes around strings when supplying special characters or list of values.
# Example: applicationPort '443 444 445'.
# Required fields left empty or faulty values (ex. typos, incorrect timezone strings, etc.)
# can result in various classes of failures, from template launch failures to silent BIG-IP deployment failures.
# Use the Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this .yaml to understand if the template
# and BIG-IP deployed correctly.

      ###  (OPTIONAL) Enter valid number of network interfaces (1-3) to create on the BIG-IP VE instance.
      numNics: 3
      ###  (OPTIONAL) Owner label.
      owner: f5owner
      ###  (OPTIONAL) Provision Public IP addresses for the BIG-IP Management interface.
      #    By default, this is set to true. If set to false, the solution will deploy a bastion host
      #    instead in order to provide access.
      provisionPublicIp: false
      ###  (OPTIONAL) Enter the Google Region in which you want to deploy BIG-IP, for example 'us-west1'.
      region: us-west1
      ###  (REQUIRED) This field restricts web application access (ports 80 and 443)
      #    to a specific network or address. Enter an IP address or address range in CIDR notation.
      #    For example, '55.55.55.55/32'.
      #    The network address should be in array format. For example:
      #    restrictedSrcAddressApp:
      #      - 0.0.0.0/0
      restrictedSrcAddressApp:
      ###  (REQUIRED) This parameter restricts network access to the BIG-IP's management interface.
      #    Provide a yaml list of addresses or networks in CIDR notation,
      #    for example, '- 55.55.55.55/32' for a host, '- 10.0.0.0/8' for a network, etc.
      #    Please restrict the IP address range to your client, for example '- X.X.X.X/32'.
      #    Production should never expose the BIG-IP Management interface to the Internet.
      #    NOTE:
      #    - The VPC CIDR is automatically added for internal use (access via bastion host, clustering, etc.).
      #    - If using a Bastion Host (when ProvisionPublicIp = false), you must also include the
      #    Bastion's source network as in the example below (w/ RFC 1918 block).
      #    restrictedSrcAddressMgmt:
      #      - 10.0.0.0/24     # Bastion Host on Mgmt Network
      #      - 55.55.55.55/32  # Client to Bastion Host

      #    For 2 NIC Deployment
      #     subnets:
      #       mgmtSubnetName: myuniqstr-mgmt
      #       externalSubnetName: myuniqstr-external
      #    For a 3 NIC Deployment

      #       externalSubnetName: myuniqstr-external
      #       internalSubnetName: myuniqstr-internal
      #    Or when deploying into a shared VPC:
      #    For 1 NIC Deployment
      #     subnets:
      #       mgmtSubnetName: projects/myVpcProjectName/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/myuniqstr-mgmt
      #    For 2 NIC Deployment

      ###  (OPTIONAL) A string that will be used in naming cloud resources.
      #    Because some resources require globally unique names, we recommend using a unique value.
      uniqueString: myuniqstr
      ###  (OPTIONAL) Enter the Google availability zone where you want to deploy the BIG-IP VE instance,
      #    for example 'us-west1-a'.
      zone: us-west1-a
    type: quickstart-existing-network.py

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# * If template did not successfully deploy, go to console.cloud.google.com Navigation Menu -> Deployment Manager -> Your Deployment Name for more details
#   TIP: See "Expanded Config" to see what the final template that was rendered/created with python script and parameters you provided
# * If template succeeded, wait ~ 6-10 Minutes (Instance needs to swap management NIC and reboot).
#       * Try Logging in via SSH to confirm BIG-IP deployment was successful (for instance, if startup scripts completed as expected on the BIG-IPs)
#           To obtain Management IP (eth0 on Single NIC, eth1 on Multi-NIC BIG-IP):
#           > Go to Console -> Compute Engine -> VM Instances -> YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME -> Network Interfaces
#           > gcloud compute instances describe YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME --zone YOUR_ZONE --format="text(networkInterfaces)"
#         Check logs: /var/log/cloud/google/*, /var/log/cloud*, /var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log, etc.
#       * If not able to log in, check "Serial port 1 (console)" output for any errors.
#           > Go to Console -> Compute Engine -> VM Instances -> YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME -> Logs
#           > gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME --port 1 --zone YOUR_ZONE
#           See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/viewing-serial-port-output
#         * See README for additional guidance on troubleshooting, filing issues, getting Support, etc.
